## Labs

This tutorial assumes you have access to either a [Microsoft Azure AKS Cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/) or another type of cluster e.g. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) or [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/learning-environment/minikube/). While Azure is used for basic infrastructure requirements the lessons learned in this tutorial can be applied to other platforms.
